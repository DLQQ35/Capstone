            <p>Cubing is a technique that encourages deeper thinking and creative expression by examining a topic from multiple angles,
            much like looking at a cube from different sides. It's a helpful tool for various subjects, including writing, math, and
            science, and can be adapted for different age groups and learning styles.</p>
            <p>The Rubik's Cube is still very popular today! It's enjoyed by people of all ages around the world, both casually and
            competitively. There's a whole community dedicated to speedcubing, where people practice solving the cube as fast as
            possible, and there are even official competitions and world records.</p>
            <p>Beyond speedcubing, the Rubik's Cube has also maintained its status as a cultural icon and a fascinating puzzle. It's
            often used as a tool for teaching concepts in mathematics and computer science, like group theory and algorithms. There
            are also many variations of the original 3x3 cube, including larger sizes (4x4, 5x5, etc.), different shapes (Pyraminx,
            Megaminx), and electronic versions. Artists and designers also continue to find creative ways to incorporate the Rubik's
            Cube into their work.</p>

            world rankings, and certify official results. If you hear about speedcubing world records or major competitions, they
            are almost always sanctioned by the WCA.</p>
