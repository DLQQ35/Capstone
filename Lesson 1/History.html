            <h1>How was the cube invented?</h1>
            <p>The Rubik's Cube was invented in 1974 by Ernő Rubik, a Hungarian architect and professor of architecture, as a teaching
            tool to help his students understand three-dimensional space. Initially called the "Magic Cube," it was designed as a
            puzzle that could be twisted and turned, and its success as a global toy was unexpected.</p><br>
            <h1>How did he solve the cube?</h1>
            <p>Ernő Rubik's solution to the Rubik's Cube was a mathematical one, based on the concept of symmetry. He realized that
            by rotating the cube in a specific way, he could solve it in a finite number of moves. He also discovered that there were
            only 26 possible states of the cube, which made it possible to solve it in a finite number of moves but it took him one month to understand it. He sat in his room for one month to finally solve it. This solution was published in 1974 in the magazine "Scientific American."</p><br>
            <h1>How did it become popular?</h1>
            <p>The popularity of the Rubik's Cube grew rapidly after it was introduced to the public in 1974. It was a popular toy among
            children and adults alike, and it became a symbol of creativity and problem-solving. It was also used as a teaching tool in
            schools and universities, and it became a popular puzzle in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, the Rubik's Cube is a global phenomenon, with millions of people around the world playing it.</p><br>
            <h1>How did the cube get its name?</h1>
            <p>The name "Rubik's Cube" was inspired by the name of the puzzle's inventor, Ernő Rubik. The cube was named after him, and
            the word "Cube" was added to the end of the name to make it easier to pronounce. The name was chosen to reflect the
            puzzle's unique shape and the fact that it was invented by a Hungarian mathematician.</p><br>
            <h1>What is the state of Rubik's Cube now?</h1>
            <p>Rubik's Cube is still a popular puzzle today, and it has become a symbol of creativity and problem-solving. It has been
            featured in many movies and TV shows, and it has inspired many artists and designers. The cube has also been used in
            scientific research, and it has been used to study the behavior of materials and the properties of light. Nowadays, Cubes come with magnets inside it, have UV Coating and have tensioning system to improve the performance and feel.</p><br>
            <h1>Is Rubik's Cube now a sport?</h1>
            <p>Yes, solving the Rubik's Cube, particularly at speed, is considered a competitive mind sport, known as speedcubing or
            speedsolving. The World Cube Association (WCA) regulates and organizes speedcubing competitions worldwide.
            Here's why it's considered a sport:
            <ul>Competitive nature:</ul>
            <li>Speedcubing involves timed competitions where individuals compete against each other to solve the Rubik's Cube (or other
            similar puzzles) as quickly as possible.</li>
            <ul>Skill-based:</ul>
            <li>Solving the cube rapidly requires a combination of mental and physical skills, including hand-eye coordination,
            reflexes, muscle memory, and the ability to execute algorithms accurately.</li>
            <ul>Global recognition:</ul>
            <li>The WCA organizes numerous competitions annually, fostering a global community of speedcubers.</li>
            <ul>World records:</ul>
            <li>The WCA recognizes world records for the fastest solves, further solidifying the competitive aspect.</li>
            While it may not be an Olympic sport yet, speedcubing has gained significant popularity and is recognized as a
            competitive mind sport with a dedicated community and governing body.</p>
